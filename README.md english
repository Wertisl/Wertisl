#  JavaScript Calculator

This is my **first calculator project**, written in **HTML** and **JavaScript**.  
It asks for two numbers and an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and shows the result in the browser console.

##  How to Use

1. Open `calculator.html` in your browser
2. Follow the prompts (input using `prompt`)
3. Open the browser console (`F12` â†’ "Console" tab) to see the result
